/*Now that everything is set up, we are ready to implement play services. Since all
our game classes are inside the libGDX core project, we canâ€™t directly call these
methods because these are Android methods. So we create an interface inside our
core project and implement this interface inside the Android Project. Makes sense ?

So inside the core Project, create a new interface and call it PlayServices. */
